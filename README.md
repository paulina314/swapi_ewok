# swapi_ewok
The purpose of this assignment is to build a server that will be able to distribute Star Wars API with
additional functionality to the SWAPI.

SWAPI 
https://swapi.dev/
Implementation of a Star Wars API, free of use.

Ewok language
https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ewok
The mapping from the English would be: all vowels are replaced with i and consonants with b.

Requirements:
1. Build a server that is proxying SWAPI.
2. The new server should extend SWAPI custom encodings with a new one - Ewok.
